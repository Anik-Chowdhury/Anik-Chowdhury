Hi there, I'm **Anik Chowdhury**.<br/>
I have recently completed a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET). My undergraduate education provided a strong foundation in fundamental mechanical engineering disciplines, including thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and materials science. During the course of my studies, I developed a profound interest in the integration of emerging technologies—such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science—into the field of mechanical engineering. This interest has significantly influenced my analytical approach, enabling me to address complex engineering problems through a combination of traditional methodologies and advanced, technology-driven solutions.<br/>
<br/>
I am open about:
- any collobration work,
- machine learning project,
- web development project and
- research internships
